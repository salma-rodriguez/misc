\opening{Dear Hiring Manager:}

I am looking for a bridge in my career between my current profession of firmware engineer and quantitative research analyst. I wish to begin as a quantitative developer or data scientist, developing applications to assist in risk management, or using data science to bring new insights to Citigroup. My vision is to drive commission on the success of investment recommendations to clients, working on innovative developments that yield high liquidity in the market and drive growth on capital assets.

Over time, I plan to grow into my career, continuing my education while employed full time and producing outstanding results through my programming experience as well as intuition for data. Studying portfolio management, econometrics, optimal control, real and stochastic analyses, planning algorithms, and competitive strategies through lifelong apprenticeship and challenging projects at work, I plan to achieve expertise in finding competitive opportunities for clients through well-researched financial instruments.

As firmware engineer at IBM, I have encountered problems with unknown solutions. To me, IBM is a company of experts, and I have grown in a team of experienced engineer, embracing many challenges while still very new in my profession. Overall, meeting the expectations of senior programmers and engineers at IBM has made a difference.

What has made me change my mind about a long-term career at IBM?

I have developed a vocation for financial engineering and management science. I have a natural curiosity for the application of mathematics, and I would like to explore interdisciplinary opportunities outside of IBM. I am also passionate about computer programming, and I expect to use programming skills extensively in my career, finding new ways to apply what I learn, and using my degree in computer science to the fullest potential.

My goal is to grow as a communicator of ideas, innovative thinker, and problem solver, all of which are important in my ability to work in a team that delivers high quality services. I hope to be given the opportunity to help Citi fulfill its vision.
